DataFusion implements an optimization called [dynamic filtering](https://datafusion.apache.org/blog/2025/09/10/dynamic-filters/)
which applies runtime filters generated during execution. Dynamic filtering relies on a shared-memory
to propagate updates from filter producers to consumers which means that it **does not automatically work** in
a distributed environment. This blog post will cover how we implemented this important optimization in Datafusion-Distributed.

## Background and Motivation

Consider a join between a small `dim` table and a large `fact` table:

```{image} ../_static/images/dynamic-filtering/hash-join-build-probe.svg
:alt: A small dim build side and a large fact probe side flow upward into a hash join.
:width: 50%
:align: center
```

A hash join first reads the small input, called the **build side**, and creates a
hash table from its join keys. It then reads the large **probe side** and looks
up each probe key in that table.

Without dynamic filtering, the probe side performs work for rows that the join
will ultimately discard:

- decoding files
- materializing columnar buffers
- hashing join columns
- evaluating expressions
- executing any potential operators between the scan and join

With dynamic filtering, the join's hash table can be pushed down to the data source via shared
memory, filtering out rows earlier to avoid wasted work:

```{figure} ../_static/images/dynamic-filtering/single-node-dynamic-filter.svg
:alt: Worker A sends build keys B and D to a hash join on Worker B. The colocated hash join sends an in-memory filter update to its fact-table scan and receives only matching rows B and D.
:width: 100%

**Figure 1**
```

In Figure 1, the producer of the runtime filter, the hash join, is collocated on the
same worker with the probe-side scan, so the runtime filter can be propagated
via shared memory.

Notably, the collocated case relies on shared references being preserved after
protobuf serialization, an important feature unblocked by
[#21807](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/21807) and
[#22011](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/22011), building upon prior
work by Adrian Garcia Badaracco in
[#15566](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15566) and
[#15568](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/15568).

For the non-collocated case (ie. the "remote" case), we cannot rely on
the standard mechanism:

```{figure} ../_static/images/dynamic-filtering/remote-probe-cannot-share-filter.svg
:alt: The hash join runs on Worker A, the build scan on Worker B, and the probe scan on Worker C. The join's shared-memory update stops at the process boundary, so the remote probe emits every row.
:width: 100%

**Figure 2**
```

Figure 2 shows a scenario where dynamic filtering does not work out of the box,
meaning extra work, such as serialization overhead and network transfer, is incurred.

In addition to hash joins, other operators like sorts and aggregates may
publish runtime filters/bounds to push down. In this post, we describe how DataFusion-Distributed
collects and carries these filters across process and network boundaries and evaluate
performance using [TPC-DS](https://www.tpc.org/tpcds/) as a benchmark.


## Design

There's two main problems to solve:

1. **Correctness:** Producers may be partitioned cross different workers and produce
   distinct expressions. What filters do we propgate to consumers? How do we ensure
   we prune the correct rows?
2. **Routing:** Consumers may be partitioned across workers and be partitioned
   differently than the producers. How do we route filters from producers to
   consumers?

The answer to these problems, implemented in DataFusion-Distributed, is similar to
the approach taken by [Trino](https://trino.io/docs/current/admin/dynamic-filtering.html) and Spark:
1. **Planning**: Discover producer-consumer relationships
2. **Collecting and Merging**: Get filter expressions from producers and merge them
3. **Forwarding and Applying**: Propagate merged expressions to consumers

### 1. Planning

Planning happens on a single query coordinator node. A plan tree is split vertically into
stage boundaries and each stage is split horizontally into parallel tasks. The example below has
two producer stages and one consumer stage consuming both filters:

```text
┌─ Stage 3 · 2 tasks
│ HashJoinExec producers=[1]
│   ...
│   NetworkShuffleExec
└────────────────────────────
  ┌─ Stage 2 · 4 tasks
  │ HashJoinExec producers=[2]
  │   ...
  │   NetworkShuffleExec
  └──────────────────────────
    ┌─ Stage 1 · 8 tasks
    │   ...
    │ DataSourceExec consumers=[1, 2]
    └──────────────────────────────
```

At planning time, producer-consumer relationships are discovered using DataFusion native APIs:
- `PhysicalExpr::expression_id()` uniquely identifies the same logical filter
  among plan nodes ([#21807](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/21807)).
- `ExecutionPlan::apply_expressions()` finds expressions owned by consumers
  ([#24018](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/24018), builds on work by Lía Castañeda in [#20337](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/20337)).
- `ExecutionPlan::dynamic_expressions_produced()` identifies dynamic filter producers
  ([#24068](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/24068)).

### 2. Collecting and Merging

Consider a partitioned producer that produces distinct filters
`F1`, ..., `Fn`. The safest option is to `OR` them together,
permitting a row accepted by any producer from `1` through `n`. This preserves
correctness at the cost of lower selectivity due to the `OR` removing partition-specific
filtering.

From that safe default, we can implement tighter bounds based on the expression or
producer type, as summarized below.

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:class: dynamic-filter-merge-table blog-numbered-table
:align: center

* - Producer shape
  - Wait for a complete filter?
  - Merge Behavior
* - Partitioned hash join
  - Yes
  - F<sub>0</sub> OR F<sub>1</sub> OR ... OR F<sub>n</sub> {bdg-primary}`Safest default`
* - CollectLeft hash join
  - Yes
  - Forward F<sub>first</sub>
* - MIN/MAX aggregate
  - No
  - F<sub>0</sub> AND F<sub>1</sub> AND ... AND F<sub>n</sub>
* - TopK sort
  - No
  - F<sub>0</sub> AND F<sub>1</sub> AND ... AND F<sub>n</sub>
```

:::{div} table-number
**Table 1**
:::

#### CollectLeft Hash Join

`CollectLeft` broadcasts one complete build side to every join task. After a
task finishes building its hash table, its predicate is equivalent to every
other task's predicate. The coordinator can therefore forward the first
complete filter to all consumers instead of waiting for duplicate reports.

```{figure} ../_static/images/dynamic-filtering/remote-collect-left-join.svg
:alt: One Stage 1 build task scans the dimension table and broadcasts its complete build side to two CollectLeft joins. The coordinator accepts the first equivalent filter, then four Stage 2 probe tasks apply it to the fact table.
:width: 100%

Figure 3
```

#### Partitioned Hash Join

Each partitioned join task sees only one slice of the build side. Publishing
`Fi` alone could reject a key owned by task `j` where `i != j`. So, the coordinator waits for all
build tasks to publish complete filter expressions and unions them together:
`Fglobal = F0 OR F1 OR ... OR Fn`. Every matching consumer receives that safe
global predicate.

```{figure} ../_static/images/dynamic-filtering/remote-partitioned-join.svg
:alt: Two Stage 1 build tasks send separate dimension partitions to two hash joins. After the joins build their hash tables and report filters, four Stage 2 probe tasks receive the merged filter and scan the fact table.
:width: 100%

Figure 4
```

##### A Note on `CASE hash(expr)`

Each filter-producing task can itself contain multiple hash partitions, controlled by
[`target_partitions`](https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/configs.html).
With `target_partitions=4`, a task's expression looks like this:

```text
CASE hash(row) % 4
  WHEN 0 THEN F0_P0(row)
  WHEN 1 THEN F0_P1(row)
  WHEN 2 THEN F0_P2(row)
  WHEN 3 THEN F0_P3(row)
END
```

Two tasks therefore create eight effective partitions, currenty represented by
OR-ing two per-task expressions:

```text
CASE hash(row) % 4
  WHEN 0 THEN F0_P0(row)
  WHEN 1 THEN F0_P1(row)
  WHEN 2 THEN F0_P2(row)
  WHEN 3 THEN F0_P3(row)
END

OR

CASE hash(row) % 4
  WHEN 0 THEN F1_P0(row)
  WHEN 1 THEN F1_P1(row)
  WHEN 2 THEN F1_P2(row)
  WHEN 3 THEN F1_P3(row)
END
```

This is correct because:

```text
(hash(key) % M) % N = hash(key) % N, when M is a multiple of N
```

In the running example, `M=8` is the number of effective partitions across `2` tasks, and `N=4` is the number of partitions per task. Consider a
row routed to global partition 5. It must select partition 1 in each `CASE` expression for correctness. The tradeoff is reduced
selectivity: 8 effective partitions behave like 4. `OR`ing means we may
admit extra rows, but it also means we cannot reject a valid row.

A more selective alternative is one large expression keyed by the global
partition index:

```text
CASE hash(row) % 8
  WHEN 0 THEN F0_P0(row)
  ...
  WHEN 4 THEN F1_P0(row)
  ...
  WHEN 7 THEN F1_P3(row)
END
```

The global `CASE` preserves selectivity by preserving all eight partitions, but it
tightly couples DataFusion-Distributed to the underling `CASE` expressions, which
may change in the future. It can also create hundreds of `CASE` branches whose
evaluation cost could counteract the benefits of early pruning. The simpler global OR is therefore
the current default. Improving selectivity remains potential future work as upstream
[expression evaluation improves](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/22883).

#### MIN/MAX Aggregate

Partial aggregates computing scalar `MIN` or `MAX` values can publish bounds
that reject rows unable to improve the result. Each published bound is independently
safe, so the coordinator intersects updates with `AND` and forwards successively
tighter predicates without waiting for all producers.

```{figure} ../_static/images/dynamic-filtering/remote-min-aggregate.svg
:alt: Two partial MIN aggregates send their local minima through a final aggregate while reporting successively lower bounds, which the coordinator intersects with AND and sends to remote scans.
:width: 100%

Figure 5
```

#### TopK Sort

A distributed TopK consists of per-task sorts followed by a
`SortPreservingMerge` that produces the global result. Each task's current
Kth-value bound is independently safe. The coordinator intersects those bounds
with `AND` and sends useful generations to remote scans while the merge continues.

```{figure} ../_static/images/dynamic-filtering/remote-topk-sort.svg
:alt: Two per-task TopK sorts send sorted candidates through a SortPreservingMerge while reporting increasingly strict bounds, which the coordinator intersects with AND and sends to remote scans.
:width: 100%

Figure 6
```

### 3. Forwarding and Applying

Once a safe predicate is ready, the coordinator sends it to workers that
contain at least one consumer with the matching `expression_id`, which are already known
from planning. Workers apply these expressions to their local running plans.


Consumers do not necessarily wait for remote filters. With sorts and aggregates,
the scan often starts before the filter arrives. With joins, the probe side
is naturally not polled until the build side is ready.

## Benchmarks

We benchmarked the implementation using TPC-DS at `scale_factor=10` in two scenarios:

- **Local:** one 16-core ARM host with 61.4 GiB of memory, four local gRPC
  workers with `target_partitions=4` per worker, and local instance storage.
- **Distributed:** 12 `c5n.4xlarge` nodes, 15 CPUs and
  `target_partitions=15` per worker, and data on S3.

### Local Benchmark Results

Figure 7 shows the ten largest local improvements.

`parquet={on,off}` refers to the following DataFusion configuration options:
- `datafusion.execution.parquet.pushdown_filters`: evaluates predicates during Parquet decoding
- `datafusion.execution.parquet.reorder_filters`: heuristically reorders pushed-down predicates to reduce evaluation cost

The average speedup across the full TPC-DS suite was `1.05x` with
`parquet=off` and `1.20x` with `parquet=on`.

With `parquet=on`, a dynamic predicate can participate in row-group, page-level,
and decoder-level row pruning, which evidently is more valuable than pruning rows
after the fact.
The [upstream DataFusion dynamic-filtering results](https://datafusion.apache.org/blog/2025/09/10/dynamic-filters/)
similarly show the importance of scan-level pruning when using dynamic filtering.

```{figure} ../_static/images/dynamic-filtering/local-tpcds-speedup.svg
:alt: Grouped bar chart comparing local TPC-DS query speedups with dynamic filtering off and on, each with Parquet row-filter pushdown and filter reordering off and on.

```

[Q80](https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-distributed/blob/a43ea4703f9d1ef668abd8f5e6865e05814ed549/testdata/tpcds/queries/q80.sql?plain=1#L3)
shows a clear improvement via metrics:

```{table}
:align: center
:class: blog-numbered-table

| Metric | Dynamic filtering off | Dynamic filtering on |
|---|---:|---:|
| Speedup | 1.00x | **2.72x** |
| Scan output rows, summed | 55.47 million | **6.23 million** |
| Join input rows, summed | 108.19 million | **9.68 million** |
| Network transfer | 1.02 GB | **88.1 MB** |
| Join compute, summed | 4,122 ms | **609 ms** |
| Coordinator updates received | 0 | **80.3** |
```

:::{div} table-number
**Table 2**
:::

Latency improved **2.72x**, and more than **90%** of network traffic disappeared
before the joins and shuffles.

Despite an average improvemenet of `1.20x` with `parquet=on`, the optimization is still not a consistent win. Figure 8 shows the ten largest
regressions:

```{figure} ../_static/images/dynamic-filtering/local-slowest-speedup.svg
:alt: Grouped bar chart comparing the ten largest local TPC-DS regressions with dynamic filtering off and on, each with Parquet row-filter pushdown and filter reordering off and on.
:width: 100%

**Figure 8**
```

[Q50](https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-distributed/blob/a43ea4703f9d1ef668abd8f5e6865e05814ed549/testdata/tpcds/queries/q50.sql?plain=1)
explains the regressions. A remote partitioned join sends a predicate to the large `store_sales` table, but the predicate is broad and
expensive to evaluate:

```{table}
:align: center
:class: blog-numbered-table

| Metric | Dynamic filtering off | Dynamic filtering on |
|---|---:|---:|
| Speedup | **1.00x** | 0.54x |
| `store_sales` predicate evaluation | **~0 s** | 4.61 s |
| `store_sales` output rows | 28.80 million | 26.70 million |
| `store_sales` bytes scanned | **168.67 MB** | 171.72 MB |
| Total join compute | 1.75 s | 1.69 s |
```

:::{div} table-number
**Table 3**
:::

The scan spends **4.61 seconds** of summed task time evaluating the predicate, but
eliminates only **7%** of sales rows and saves no scan bytes. The join
compute time is basically unchanged and does not repay that filter evaluation cost.

### Distributed Benchmark Results

In the distributed scenario, we re-ran the 10 queries which demonstrated the best local improvement. The
results are summarized in Figure 9.

```{figure} ../_static/images/dynamic-filtering/remote-tpcds-speedup.svg
:alt: Grouped bar chart comparing distributed TPC-DS query speedups with dynamic filtering off and on, each with Parquet row-filter pushdown and filter reordering off and on.
:width: 100%

**Figure 9**
```

Only five queries reproduced a performance gain (in any `parquet` configuration).

We investigated Q80 to see why. Despite the higher network latency in a non-local scenario,
dynamic filters arrived on time and pruned the same amount of rows. The main difference was
in the scan behavior.

```{table}
:align: center
:class: blog-numbered-table

| Metric | Dynamic filtering off | Dynamic filtering on |
|---|---:|---:|
| Execution speedup | 1.00x | **0.855x** |
| First-result latency | 803 ms | **943 ms** |
| Critical `store_sales` output | 28.800 M rows | **0.592 M rows** |
| Decoder data requested | 1.058 GB | **1.058 GB** |
| Decoder reads per output stream | 1 | **5** |
| Mean file-stream first-batch delay | 151 ms | **339 ms** |
| Critical fact-stage finish | 771 ms | **906 ms** |
| Total network transfer | 1.353 GB | **128 MB** |
| Critical scan-poll CPU, summed | 2.801 s | **2.432 s** |
```

:::{div} table-number
**Table 4**
:::

Q80 removes **98%** of critical scan rows and **91%** of network traffic, yet the query
regresses. Scan CPU falls 13%, ruling out expensive predicate evaluation as the
cause. Figure 10 shows the actual reason for the increased latency.

```{figure} ../_static/images/dynamic-filtering/q80-s3-read-phases.svg
:alt: Two timelines compare Q80 with dynamic filtering off and on over S3. With filtering off, one combined range read streams shuffle batches. With filtering on, five dependent reads each require an S3 call and sparse shuffle output is buffered until end-of-stream.
:width: 100%

**Figure 10**
```

Without dynamic filtering, one combined S3 range read is used per file. With filtering, the
parquet data source issues five dependent reads. Each red marker in Figure 10 represents a
separate S3 call. 5 synchronous I/O operations are cheap against warm local storage, but expensive
when the data needs to be downloaded. This overhead turns Q80's local **2.72x** improvement into a
**0.855x** regression in a distributed setting. Fortunately, [DataFusion issue #24393](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/24393)
tracks this exact problem, and DataFusion makes it easy to implement a custom data source
that does not use this I/O pattern.

## Conclusion

distributed dynamic filtering is implemented with datafusion's native physical
plan and expression apis. colocated filters are automatically propagated to consumers via shared-memory, while
remote filters require merging and forwarding via the coorindator. 

For dynamic filtering to be effective, it is important to consider the following: 

1. Dynamic filtering is most valuable when it prevent rows from being read and decoded. Pushing down
   to the decoder level or remote data sources will yeild the best results.
2. Dynamic filtering is a tradeoff. It wins when early pruning saves more work
   than the filter propagation and predicate evaluation cost.
3. Connector and leaf-node implementation matters. Access patterns and
   predicate pushdown can make or break the optimization.
